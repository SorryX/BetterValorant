# nValorant
nValorant is an app that helps you analyze, learn about your game at blazing speeds with in-deep stats and all made in modern C++
<hr>
**Note** that this app is in it's early stages and is probably not usable!

## For developers
I'm also making an api wrapper for c++ which can be taken and used for other projects!

The api currently only supports the region EU but can be changed easily to any other, I will be adding
a way to get the region automatically or manually choosen by the user

## Features

- Automatic Login
- Automatic Launch ( Run the game through the app )
- Instant Lock ( Use it at your own risk as it may get you banned )
- Deselect agent ( Use it at your own risk as it may get you banned )
- See Teammates & opponents
  - Rank
  - Level
  - and more
- See your stats more in deep

## Libraries

- ImGui
  - For the user interface
- libcpr
  - For requests
- fmt
  - formatting strings
- macaron base64
  - encoding base64
- nlohmann/json
  - to parse responses
- stb_image
  - buffer to texture

## How it works
explanation soon!

## Readme
