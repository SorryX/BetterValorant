# nValorant
nValorant is an app that helps you analyze, learn about your game at blazing speeds with in-deep stats and all made in modern C++
<hr>
<strong>Note</strong> that this app is in it's early stages and is probably not usable!

## For developers
I'm also making an api wrapper for c++ which can be taken and used for other projects!

The api currently only supports the region EU but can be changed easily to any other, I will be adding
a way to get the region automatically or manually choosen by the user
